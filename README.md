# Welcome to my Esri CityEngine playground

## What is this?
I like to play around with Esri's Computer Generated Architecture (CGA) rule files. And sometimes I actually create something you can look at.

These working rules are published here so others might get inspired on writing (and how to write) their own rules.

## Current Contents

### Ferris Wheel
A ferris wheel that can easily change diameter, width, cart number, cart color and more parts. Most of them can be changed through handles.

### Graduation Hat
You can change diameter, height, and length of multiple parts of the graduation hat such as the cylinder width and height as well as the cord diameter.

### Snow Flake
A randomized snow flake. Changing the Seed changes the snow flake's arms.

I provide all content with absolutely no support or warranty whatsoever. If you file an issue I might be willing to fix bugs or implement features but I refuse any and all guarantees to do so.
